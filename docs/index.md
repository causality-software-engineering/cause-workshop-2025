# Description

## Motivation
This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and students to explore the growing field of causal inference and, more broadly, causal AI (including causal discovery, mediation analysis, counterfactual analysis, root-cause and causal attribution analysis) in software engineering. Causal inference methods allow the identification and estimation of causal effects from observational data, distinguishing between spurious correlations and causal effects. Despite a growing interest in the topic, the application of such methods in software engineering is not widespread, and there is a need to foster a community to exchange and promote scientific activities on the topic.

## Workshop goals
The workshop will provide a platform for participants to share their research, experiences, and insights on causal inference methods and their applications in software engineering. It will also facilitate networking and collaboration opportunities, encouraging the development of a strong community.

## Planned workshop agenda and expected types of submissions

We plan to organise a full day workshop. The agenda will include: an introductory tutorial on causal inference methods, a keynote speech, paper presentations, and a concluding panel discussion on challenges and future perspectives.


The workshop will accept the following types of contributions

- Full papers (maximum 8 pages) describing original, complete and validated research.
- Position/short papers (maximum 4 pages) that present forward-looking ideas or work in progress with emerging results, thought-provoking reflections, or that propose potential new directions for the community.
- Tool and artefact papers (maximum 4 pages) for researchers wishing to present tools, tool extensions or artefacts (e.g. benchmark datasets) relevant to the workshop.
